# Genomic and Geographic Adaptations to Climate Change: A Comparative Study of Wild Yak, Takin, and High-Altitude Bovids 

* The project examines climate adaptation in high-altitude bovids—Wild Yak, Takin, and Water Buffalo—by integrating species distribution modeling with comparative genomics.
* The study focuses on the effects of climate change on habitat suitability and the genetic adaptations that support survival in extreme environments. 
* Machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, are applied using Python and R to analyze occurrence records, environmental variables, spatial jittering, and centroid tracking for predicting current and future habitats. 
* Genomic analyses employ tools such as Mash for genome-wide similarity, InterProScan for protein domain annotation, ProteinOrtho for ortholog identification, and GO enrichment to reveal key adaptive signals. 
* The results indicate that while wild yak habitats are expected to contract and shift to higher altitudes, takin habitats may expand, providing valuable insights for conservation strategies.
